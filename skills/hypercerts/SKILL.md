# Hypercerts Skills

This meta-skill helps users discover and install focused Hypercerts agent skills. It does not contain the full task instructions for ePDS, Hyperindex, CGS, OrgLabeler, or Hypercerts lexicons.

Use it when a user asks about Hypercerts and the right focused skill is not installed yet, or when they ask which Hypercerts skill they need.

## Default procedure

1. Choose the smallest matching focused skill from [the skill map](references/skill-map.md).
2. Install it using [the install reference](references/install.md).
3. Use `--yes` in automated agents, scripts, CI jobs, and other non-interactive environments.
4. Locate and read the installed focused skill's `SKILL.md`.
5. Continue using the focused skill's own instructions.

## Gotchas

- Do not try to invoke another skill by name from this skill. The portable Agent Skills format does not define cross-skill invocation.
- Do not assume where a skill was installed. Locate its `SKILL.md` if needed.
- If a source-repository install fails, retry with the direct-directory fallback from the skill map.
